FAIBCompiler
============

FAIBCompiler comtains the functions to run VRI and PSP compilers. The
compilers

-   load data from FAIB oracle ground sample databases using package
    **FAIBOracle**,
-   manipulate tree/stand-level tables, calculate tree/stand-level
    attributes such as basal area and volume using **FAIBBase**,
-   save and archive them.

### Features

The branch VGISCompiler saves the previous version of VRICompiler and
first version of ISMCCompiler on Nov.Â 24, 2020. The version freezes
those two compilers due to a major change of cluster id. Specifically,
the formation cluster id in this branch is formated as
proj\_id-samp\_no-samp\_type-visit, while in the future development, the
cluster id will be formated as site\_identifier-samp\_type-visit. The
unique spatial sample point also changed due to change of ISMC EFR, from
proj\_id-samp\_no in current branch to site\_identifier in the future
compiler.
